# iOSAppPrototypeIcons
Better app icons for your iOS prototypes. This is an xcasset you can drop into any Xcode project. The default app icon generated by Xcode doesnâ€™t offer much when distinguishing your prototypes between each other. A homescreen covered in default, boring, black and white, app icons generated by Xcode is annoying. All you have is 9pt text to distinguish one prototype from another. For client services, these app icons are also kind of confusing and ugly. This repo can get you one step closer to dope.
